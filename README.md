# Best Death Bowlers in IPL (2022–2024) – Tableau Visualization  

## 📌 Overview  
This project was created as part of my Sports Analytics internship at Infosys Springboard and Collearn.  
It analyzes the performance of bowlers in the death overs (16–20) across the last three IPL seasons (2022–2024). The analysis identifies the most effective death bowlers based on multiple performance metrics and presents the results in an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
 

## 🎯 Objective  
The death overs are crucial in determining the outcome of a T20 match. This project evaluates bowlers’ effectiveness in this phase by comparing:  
- Economy Rate  
- Bowling Strike Rate  
- Dot Ball Percentage  
- Wickets Taken  

## 📊 Visualization Details  
- **Scatter Plot**: Economy (Y-axis) vs. Bowling Strike Rate (X-axis)  
- **Bubble Size**: Total wickets taken in death overs  
- **Color Intensity**: Dot ball percentage  
- **Filters**: Arm type, bowling style, dot %, economy, strike rate  
- **Tooltip**: Player details, economy, strike rate, dot %, wickets  

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- **M Pathirana, Rashid Khan, and Jasprit Bumrah** are among the most economical bowlers.  
- **Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, and T Natarajan** stand out as consistent wicket-takers.  
- **Anrich Nortje and Lockie Ferguson** have high strike rates but are expensive options.
